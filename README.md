# Geopolitical ACH Forecasting Agent

**Final Project for CMU Agentic AI Certificate Program (July 2026)**  
**Student**: James Kajdasz

## Overview

A **three-tier multi-agent system** that applies **Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH)** to geopolitical news, autonomously ingesting full-text articles, scoring their diagnostic value against competing hypotheses, and maintaining a versioned evidence matrix for probabilistic forecasting (e.g. China's likely position in a US–Iran conflict).

**Key features**:
- 🔄 **Linear multi-agent pipeline**: Scraper → Assessment → Matrix, with sequential handoff
- 📰 **Full-text sourcing**: articles come from **The Guardian Open Platform Content API** (full article body, free developer key)
- 🧠 **Comparative ACH scoring**: all competing hypotheses are scored together in one LLM call so the model discriminates between them; temperature-sampled multi-pass **self-consistency** yields per-hypothesis confidence with human-in-the-loop flagging
- 📊 **Accumulating ACH matrix (Heuer Ch. 8)**: evidence rows (one per article) build up **across runs**, ranked by *inconsistency*, rendered to a color-coded HTML matrix with versioned snapshots and a storage cap
- 🔒 **Security-first**: domain whitelisting, no user chat interface, API keys kept out of logs, comprehensive audit logging
- 🖥️ **Live CLI**: streaming progress and a formatted result table (`rich`)
- 🧪 **Tested**: hermetic pytest suite (no network/LLM needed)
- 🚀 **Local LLM inference** via Ollama (GPU-accelerated, CPU fallback)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com) with a **long-context** model pulled (see below)
- NVIDIA GPU recommended (dual TITAN RTX); CPU works but is slower

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (creates .venv)
uv sync

# 2. (Optional) create a local config; defaults work out of the box
cp .env.template .env

# 3. Install Ollama and pull a long-context model.
#    llama3.1 (128k context) is the default — it can ingest full articles;
#    a 4k model like llama2 would truncate them.
ollama pull llama3.1
#    On Windows, Ollama runs automatically as a background service after install.
#    On Linux/macOS, start it with:  ollama serve
```

### Running

```bash
uv run python main.py
```

> Use `uv run python main.py` rather than bare `python main.py` so the project's
> virtual environment (and its dependencies) are used regardless of shell activation.

A run streams live progress to the terminal and prints the final ACH matrix as a table. Because a full run is `SCRAPER_MAX_ARTICLES × LLM_NUM_PASSES` LLM calls over full-length articles (default 25 × 10 = 250), **smoke-test small first**:

```powershell
# PowerShell
$env:SCRAPER_MAX_ARTICLES=3; $env:LLM_NUM_PASSES=2; uv run python main.py
```
```bash
# bash
SCRAPER_MAX_ARTICLES=3 LLM_NUM_PASSES=2 uv run python main.py
```

### What a run does

1. **Tier 1 — Scraper**: query The Guardian Content API for recent, relevant articles; deduplicate against previously processed URLs.
2. **Tier 2 — Assessment**: for each article, score all competing hypotheses together across N temperature-sampled passes; derive per-hypothesis confidence from self-consistency and flag low-confidence results for human review.
3. **Tier 3 — Matrix**: add each article as an evidence row to the ACH matrix (carried over from prior runs), rank hypotheses by inconsistency, and render the color-coded HTML matrix.

### Outputs

- Live console: streaming progress + the **hypothesis ranking** (by inconsistency)
- `data/matrix/acch_matrix.html` — the color-coded ACH matrix to open in a browser
- `data/matrix/matrix_state.json` — canonical matrix state (reloaded next run); plus timestamped `acch_matrix_v*.html` snapshots
- `data/processed_urls.csv` — long-term dedup memory
- `logs/agent_interactions.log`, `logs/assessments.log`, `logs/errors.log` — audit trail

## Architecture

### Three-Tier Pipeline

```
The Guardian Content API
        ↓
[Tier 1: Scraper Agent]
  - Query the Guardian API (site-wide, full body text) for relevant articles
  - Enforce domain whitelist; deduplicate against processed_urls.csv
  - Output: ArticleData[] → Assessment Agent
        ↓
[Tier 2: Assessment Agent]
  - Score ALL competing hypotheses together in one LLM call (comparative ACH)
  - Run N temperature-sampled passes; measure per-hypothesis self-consistency
  - Flag low-confidence assessments for human review
  - Output: AssessmentResult[] → Matrix Agent
        ↓
[Tier 3: Matrix Agent]
  - Maintain an evidence-row matrix (one row per article) accumulating across runs
  - Rank hypotheses by INCONSISTENCY (fewest/weakest evidence against = most likely)
  - Flag diagnosticity; carry per-article confidence and date
  - Output: a color-coded HTML matrix (data/matrix/acch_matrix.html) + JSON state
```

### Why The Guardian (and not Reuters)?

The project is named for a Reuters-style geopolitical use case, but Reuters' Terms of Use prohibit scraping and its full text is available only via the licensed Reuters Connect platform (see `documentation/Reuters_Delivery_Overview.pdf`). The Guardian's **Open Platform Content API** is the standout free, official alternative that returns the **full article body** with a developer key — so the Scraper Agent sources from it. The architecture is source-agnostic: the agent only emits `ArticleData`, so the source can be swapped.

### Assessment Agent: Comparative ACH Self-Consistency

ACH evidence is diagnostic only insofar as it distinguishes between competing hypotheses, so all hypotheses are evaluated **together**:

1. **Comparative pass**: one LLM call presents the article plus all hypotheses and returns a mark per hypothesis. The prompt instructs that an article not addressing a hypothesis is `N/A` (not weak support), and that mutually exclusive hypotheses shouldn't all get the same positive mark.
2. **Multi-pass sampling**: run N passes (default 10) at `temperature=0.7`.
3. **Self-consistency**: per hypothesis, confidence = fraction of passes agreeing with that hypothesis's majority mark.
   - e.g. 8/10 passes agree on `+` → confidence 0.8; a 5/5 split → 0.5 (ambiguous → flagged).
4. **Cost**: `LLM_NUM_PASSES` calls per article (one comparative call per pass — not per hypothesis). The full article body is sent (Ollama `num_ctx` is set so it isn't truncated).

> **Accuracy note**: directional judgment is bounded by the local model's reasoning. Unstable or low-confidence assessments are surfaced via the human-review flag by design, rather than hidden.

### ACH Matrix (Heuer Chapter 8 layout)

Following Heuer's ACH, the matrix is **evidence (articles) down the rows, hypotheses across the columns** — preserving the per-article audit trail rather than collapsing to tallies. Each row also carries the article's **date**, **confidence** (self-consistency), and a **diagnosticity** flag; rows are shown most-recent-first.

```
Date        Article                              H1   H2   H3   Conf  Diag
2026-06-22  US-Iran framework deal reached …     N/A  ++   −    83%   ✓
2026-06-21  China FM welcomes Tehran to talks …  −    +    ++    100%  ✓
…
```

**Ranking by inconsistency (Step 5):** hypotheses are ranked by an **inconsistency score** (weighted evidence *against*: `−`=1, `−−`=2) — **the most likely hypothesis is the one with the *least* evidence against it, not the most evidence for it.** This is the methodologically correct measure per Heuer (it explicitly is *not* a "most pluses wins" tally).

State persists as `data/matrix/matrix_state.json` (reloaded each run so evidence accumulates, deduped by article id). The viewable result is `data/matrix/acch_matrix.html` (a color-coded matrix you open in a browser), with a timestamped HTML snapshot kept per run as an audit trail.

## Configuration

All settings have defaults (`config/settings.py`) and can be overridden via environment variables or `.env`.

### Hypotheses (`config/hypothesis_config.yaml`)

```yaml
hypotheses:
  - id: "h1"
    name: "China supports US position"
    description: "..."
```

Edit to define different competing hypotheses for other scenarios.

### Domain whitelist (`config/domain_whitelist.txt`)

Only listed domains are fetchable by the Scraper Agent. Default: `content.guardianapis.com` and `theguardian.com`.

### Key environment variables (`.env`)

```bash
# LLM (Ollama)
LLM_MODEL=llama3.1               # must support the configured context window
LLM_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:11434
LLM_NUM_PASSES=10                # self-consistency passes per article
LLM_CONTEXT_WINDOW=8192          # Ollama num_ctx; large enough for full articles

# Article source (The Guardian)
GUARDIAN_API_KEY=test            # 'test' for dev; register a free key for production
GUARDIAN_SECTION=world           # empty string = all sections
GUARDIAN_FROM_DAYS=7             # recency window (0 = disable)
GUARDIAN_ORDER_BY=relevance      # relevance | newest | oldest
SCRAPER_MAX_ARTICLES=25

# Assessment / storage
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.6         # flag hypotheses below this confidence
MATRIX_STORAGE_CAP_GB=1.0
ENABLE_DEBUG_LOGGING=false
```

## Development

### Tests

The suite is hermetic — all network/LLM calls are mocked and file I/O uses temp dirs, so it needs no Ollama, Guardian access, or internet:

```bash
uv run pytest                              # run all tests
uv run pytest tests/test_matrix_agent.py   # a single file
uv run pytest -k accumulation              # by keyword
uv run pytest --cov=agents --cov=tools     # with coverage
```

### Adding hypotheses

Edit `config/hypothesis_config.yaml`, then re-run `uv run python main.py`. (The matrix keys columns by `hypothesis_id`; new ids appear as new columns and accumulate from then on.)

### Debug mode

```bash
ENABLE_DEBUG_LOGGING=true uv run python main.py
```

### Checking the GPU

```bash
uv run python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available(), torch.cuda.device_count())"
```

## Notes & Known Limitations

- **TLS behind a proxy**: when behind a TLS-inspecting proxy, set/keep `USE_SYSTEM_TRUSTSTORE=true` (default). The scraper verifies HTTPS against the OS trust store via the `truststore` package, keeping verification on without disabling it.
- **Guardian `test` key** is rate-limited and intended for development; register a free production key at <https://open-platform.theguardian.com/>.
- **Model-bounded accuracy**: the assessment is only as good as the local model; low-confidence results are flagged for human review rather than trusted blindly.
- **First run can be slow**: 25 articles × 10 passes over full articles is ~250 LLM calls — smoke-test with reduced settings first.

## Future Enhancements (v2+)

- **Conclusion Agent** — Tree-of-Thought synthesis of matrix snapshots with hypothesis decay weighting
- **Notification Agent** — alerts when conclusions shift beyond a threshold
- **RAG integration** — semantic re-ranking / historical retrieval of article embeddings (`sentence-transformers`)
- **Multi-source ingestion** — combine the Guardian with other compliant sources
- **Web dashboard** — visualize the matrix, manage hypotheses, review flagged items

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `LLM service unavailable` | Ensure Ollama is running and the model is pulled (`ollama list`). Check `LLM_ENDPOINT`. |
| Articles get truncated / poor scoring on long pieces | Use a long-context model (e.g. `llama3.1`) and ensure `LLM_CONTEXT_WINDOW` fits the article. |
| `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` on fetch | Behind a TLS-inspecting proxy — keep `USE_SYSTEM_TRUSTSTORE=true` (default). |
| No new articles found | All matching URLs are already in `data/processed_urls.csv`, or widen `GUARDIAN_FROM_DAYS` / change the query. |
| Run is very slow | Lower `LLM_NUM_PASSES` and/or `SCRAPER_MAX_ARTICLES`. |
| Storage growing | Lower `MATRIX_STORAGE_CAP_GB`; oldest snapshots auto-prune. |
